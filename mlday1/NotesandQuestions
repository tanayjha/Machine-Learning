NOTES

# Characters in python are single length string
# List can contain anything
# We can do (npArray + constant) but not (list + constant)
# matplotlib.pyplot.plot takes two list the x and the y axis and they should have the same dimension
# plt.scatter(a, b) only plots the point
# No order in dictionary
# String characters cannot be changed. A new string has to be created



# boston dataset
# a.data --> x
# a.target --> y
# len(a.target) --> data size
# a.feature_names --> data name
# a.DESCR --> complete discription


QUESTIONS

1. What should be the initial values for a0 and a1 in linear regression?
2. Why are the number of coefficients in the model one less than the number of features (line passing through origin)?
